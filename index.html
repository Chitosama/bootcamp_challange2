            As a husband and father of 3, I have had the privilage of having a
            growing ability for patience. Patience with marriage, kids and
            growing pains. Between Disney family outings, San Diego Comic Con
            outings and family gatherings there is so much to experience, learn
            and have patience for those around you to learn and grow.

            As a growing engineer. I am looking for a place to contribut and
            learn. My experiences have lead me to understanding many different
            paths. Currently I am Sr. Solutions Enigineer who works specifically
            with API implementations against our API. Prior to this I assisted
            with testing as a QA enginer and prior to that I lead a support
            team. I am a proven and test life long learner as I got my degree
            while working and am now doing a Bootcamp while working.
